This is the source code I used for my honeypot project. A lot of it is hacked 
together but hopefully someone will find it useful!


# blacklist.rb 

Generates list of IP's that have been carrying out SSH attacks

# report.php

Gets the IP address from the kippo DB and reports the IP for abuse if certain 
conditions are met. Then saves the information to a 'report' table for 
displaying the information at a later date.

# dump.php

This was used to output the UML blobs in the Kippo DB to a file to be read by
ajaxterm. 


# current-charts.rb

Ruby script I used to create the graphs for the front page. 

# snippets.php

This is just wee snippets of code I used through-out my code that I think might
be useful to some people :-)
